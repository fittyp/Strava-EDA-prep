Ended up going like 3:30, for the first one and like a smidge faster on each, like 3:25 ish, But the last 4 min was like 3:07 pace lol. Was just feeling good and tbh the competitive edge came out. Wanted to like show off the work, and stay ahead. Lead most of the work out. Especially towards the end. Even stayed ahead of Mikael. The beginning 8 min at 3:30 felt v chill. Glad to be rolling, but I’m on longer thicker workouts mikael and the guys coulda out ran me. Still happy to see that work shine through tho.
